    Despite the growing popularity of online short backgammon games, live
    tournaments continue to be organized and held worldwide. They are often part
    of a tournament series.
  </p>
  <p>
    To participate in a live tournament, a fee is required. Typically,
    tournaments feature competitions in several categories: beginners,
    intermediates, and masters. In addition, side events (such as doubles,
    women's tournaments, veterans' competitions, etc.) are often organized
    within the tournament. The higher the tournament's status, the larger the
    participation fee.
  </p>
  <p>All tournaments involve matches played with a doubling cube.</p>
  <p>
    The most well-known and respected organizers of European tournaments are
    Marco Fornasir (Italy) and Arda Findikoglu (Turkey).
  </p>
  <p>
    Sometimes, online competitions offer qualifications for major live
    tournaments. Winners receive coverage for their participation fees and
    accommodations.
  </p>
  <p>
    The World Championships held annually in Monte Carlo, Monaco, stand out as
    special events.
