    At the end of 2014, an international organization for awarding titles in
    backgammon, known as BMAB (Backgammon Masters Awarding Body), was
    established.

    In December 2014, the first tournament was held in Austria, where all
    matches were recorded on video, and protocols were created based on these
    recordings. This provided the opportunity to determine the PR (Performance
    Rating) of each player in the tournament. The initial titles were then
    awarded based on the obtained PR.
